# Scripts
Small scripts that support investigations (parsing logs, extracting indicators, converting timestamps, enrichment helpers).

## Rules
- Keep scripts short and readable
- Add comments and a simple usage example
- Do not include secrets, API keys, or real credentials

## Naming convention
Use: 'purpose_language.ext'

## Each script should include
- What it does
- Input format
- Output format
- How to run it
